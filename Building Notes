To build this project you need to use STM32Cube IDE software package.
<BR><BR>
Once the software is installed, executing it will ask you to select a workspace directory.  Create and select an empty folder, hit the launch button.
<BR><BR>
It will give you a few choices on the left to make a project, select 'Start new project from STM32CubeMX file (.ioc)'  and wait for a bit.
<BR><BR>
Once the requestor comes up select the file, Browse and select the file 'SW7456.ioc' included in this project. Select the 'Finish' button and wait.
<BR><BR>
Now you need to copy the osd directory from this project into the directory you created in the first step. (YourDir/SW7456/osd) And add the files to the project.
<BR><BR>
Adding files is goofy in this tool, To add files you need to select SW7456 on the left panel, then select the menu 'project : properties'. 
From here select 'C/C++ General' then 'Paths and Symbols'.  Now there should be a series of tabs on the upper part, select the 'Source Location' tab and add the directory 'osd'.
<BR><BR>
Now add the include path '../osd' to the projoject using...  'project : properties', 'C/C++ Build' then 'Settings' which opens another list.  
Select 'MCU GCC Compiler : Include paths' in the new list than add the path '../osd'  There is a tiny icon that you need to click to do this. the fist one on the top.
<BR>
You may want to set a few other options while you are here,  the software expects -O2 optimization to be used which may not be the default.
<BR>
<BR>
Now you need to edit some files created in the above steps 
<br>In the file 'Core/Src/main.c' add the line ' #include "osd_glue.h" ' in the appropriate place  Then search for 'while (1)' in the file and add the functions 'osd_init(); osd_loop();' 
<BR> Just one more file to fix, 'Core/src/stm32g0xx_it.c', look at the bottom of the file 'osd_irq.c' to see the change but adding '{osd_comp_irq();return;}' at the top of the 'void ADC1_COMP_IRQHandler(void)' should work.

It now should build proprerly?  It does over here.  If not, welcome to the joys of software development.
