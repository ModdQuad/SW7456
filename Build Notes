To build this project you need to use STM32Cube IDE software package.

Once the software is installed, executing it will ask you to select a workspace directory.  
Create and select an empty folder, hit the launch button.

It will give you a few choices on the left to make a project, select 'Start new project from STM32CubeMX file (.ioc)'  and wait for a bit.

Once the requestor comes up select the file, Browse and select the file 'SW7456.ioc' included in this project. Select the 'Finish' button and wait.

Now you need to copy the osd directory from this project into the directory you created in the first step. (YourDir/SW7456/osd) 
And add the osd files to the project.

Adding files is goofy in this tool, To add files you need to select SW7456 on the left panel, then select the menu 'project : properties'. 
From here select 'C/C++ General' then 'Paths and Symbols'.
Now there should be a series of tabs on the upper part, select the 'Source Location' tab and add the directory 'osd'.

Now add the include path '../osd' to the project using...  
'project : properties', 'C/C++ Build' then 'Settings' which opens another list.  
Select 'MCU GCC Compiler : Include paths' in the new list.
Now add the path '../osd'  There is a tiny icon that you need to click to do this. the first one on the top.

You may want to set a few other GCC options while you are here,  the software expects -O2 optimization level which is not the default.
-O0 is supported but you will need to change a line in osd_irq.c that sets the horizontal start position.

Now you need to edit some files created in the above steps 

In the file 'Core/Src/main.c' add the line 
#include "osd_glue.h"   in the appropriate place  
Then search for 'while (1)' in the file and add the functions 
osd_init(); 
osd_loop(); // never returns 

Just one more file to fix, 'Core/src/stm32g0xx_it.c', 
look at the bottom of the file 'osd_irq.c' to see the change 
but adding '{osd_comp_irq();return;}' at the top of the 'void ADC1_COMP_IRQHandler(void)' function should work.


It now should build proprerly?  It does over here.  If not, welcome to the joys of software development.
